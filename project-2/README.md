This folder contains my submission for Project 02 for ENGI 301 F22, which is a design of a PCB board for a standard Etch-a-Sketch developed on a PocketBeagle platform. Within this folder is a .pdf file of my schematic ("schematicpdf"), the Bill of Materials for my design ("etchasketchBOM"), an "mfg" sub-folder containing my manufacturing gerber files generated by Eagle, a "docs" sub-folder containing my mechanical diagram and screenshots of the top and bottom layer of my PCB board, and finally, an "EAGLE_Subfolder" sub-folder which contains the Eagle files for this design - the schematic, library, board, and design rules files.
